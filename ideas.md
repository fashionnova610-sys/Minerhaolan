<idea>
  **Design Movement**: Industrial Futurism
  **Core Principles**:
  1. **Precision Engineering**: Layouts that emphasize technical accuracy and structured data.
  2. **High-Tech Reliability**: Visuals that convey trust, stability, and cutting-edge performance.
  3. **Global Connectivity**: Elements that suggest a worldwide network and seamless logistics.
  4. **Performance Visualization**: Using data-driven graphics to represent hashrate and efficiency.

  **Color Philosophy**:
  - **Deep Navy & Electric Blue**: Represents the cold efficiency of data centers and the digital nature of crypto.
  - **Metallic Silver & Gunmetal**: Evokes the hardware aspect of ASIC miners.
  - **Signal Orange**: Used sparingly for critical actions (Buy, Contact) to guide user attention like industrial safety indicators.
  - **Intent**: To make the user feel they are interacting with professional-grade industrial equipment, not just a retail store.

  **Layout Paradigm**:
  - **Modular Dashboard Style**: Content organized in cards and panels reminiscent of mining software interfaces.
  - **Asymmetric Grid**: Breaking the standard e-commerce grid to highlight featured hardware with dynamic sizing.
  - **Sticky Technical Specs**: Key performance metrics (TH/s, Watts) always visible or easily accessible.

  **Signature Elements**:
  - **Circuit Board Patterns**: Subtle background textures or dividers.
  - **Data Stream Animations**: Micro-interactions that suggest data flow.
  - **Hexagonal Motifs**: Nod to blockchain structure and hardware mesh.

  **Interaction Philosophy**:
  - **Tactile Feedback**: Buttons and controls that feel mechanical and responsive.
  - **Instant Data**: Hover states that reveal detailed technical specifications immediately.

  **Animation**:
  - **Slide-in Panels**: For technical details to slide in like server rack components.
  - **Pulse Effects**: On "Live" or "In Stock" indicators.

  **Typography System**:
  - **Headings**: *Rajdhani* or *Chakra Petch* (Square, technical sans-serif) for a futuristic, industrial look.
  - **Body**: *Roboto* or *Inter* for clean, legible technical reading.
  - **Monospace**: *JetBrains Mono* for pricing and technical specs to align numbers perfectly.

  **Design Movement**: Neo-Brutalism / Crypto-Native
  **Core Principles**:
  1. **Raw Authenticity**: Unapologetic display of hardware and pricing without fluff.
  2. **High Contrast**: Bold visual hierarchy to cut through noise.
  3. **Digital Sovereignty**: Aesthetics that emphasize decentralization and user control.
  4. **Speed & Efficiency**: A UI that feels incredibly fast and lightweight.

  **Color Philosophy**:
  - **Stark Black & White**: Maximum contrast for readability.
  - **Neon Green & Acid Purple**: Crypto-native accent colors that signal "Web3".
  - **Intent**: To appeal to the crypto-native audience who values directness and the "punk" ethos of early Bitcoin culture.

  **Layout Paradigm**:
  - **Bold Borders**: Thick outlines around product cards and sections.
  - **Oversized Typography**: Headlines that dominate the screen.
  - **Marquee Scrollers**: For tickers, announcements, and scrolling text.

  **Signature Elements**:
  - **Pixel Art Icons**: Retro-digital aesthetic.
  - **Glitch Effects**: Subtle visual distortions on hover.
  - **Raw HTML Elements**: Styled to look like default browser inputs but with a modern twist.

  **Interaction Philosophy**:
  - **Snap & Click**: Sharp, instant transitions without easing.
  - **Hover Reveals**: Brutalist overlays that cover images with text on hover.

  **Animation**:
  - **Hard Cuts**: No fades, just instant state changes.
  - **Marquee Scrolling**: Continuous movement for urgency.

  **Typography System**:
  - **Headings**: *Space Grotesk* or *Syne* for a quirky, distinct character.
  - **Body**: *DM Sans* for geometric clarity.
  - **Monospace**: *Space Mono* for all data points.

  **Design Movement**: Swiss International Style (Digital Edition)
  **Core Principles**:
  1. **Objective Clarity**: Information is presented without decoration or bias.
  2. **Grid Systems**: Rigorous adherence to a mathematical grid for order.
  3. **Asymmetry**: Dynamic balance rather than centered symmetry.
  4. **Typography as Image**: Type is the primary design element.

  **Color Philosophy**:
  - **International Orange & Slate Blue**: A classic, high-visibility combination used in transportation and logistics.
  - **Neutral Greys**: To let the product photography stand out.
  - **Intent**: To position MinerHaolan as a reliable, logistical partner in the global mining infrastructure, emphasizing the "Hong Kong Vendor" aspect of efficiency and trade.

  **Layout Paradigm**:
  - **Modular Grid**: Content blocks that align perfectly.
  - **Whitespace**: Generous use of negative space to structure information.
  - **Left-Aligned Text**: Strict adherence to left alignment for readability.

  **Signature Elements**:
  - **Heavy Rule Lines**: Thick horizontal lines separating sections.
  - **Large Numbering**: Numbered lists and steps in oversized type.
  - **Iconography**: Simple, universal pictograms.

  **Interaction Philosophy**:
  - **Smooth & Precise**: Transitions that feel engineered and fluid.
  - **Focus States**: Clear indication of where the user is.

  **Animation**:
  - **Parallax Scrolling**: Subtle depth between layers.
  - **Fade & Slide**: Gentle entry animations for content.

  **Typography System**:
  - **Headings**: *Helvetica Now Display* or *Inter Tight* (Bold, tight tracking).
  - **Body**: *Inter* or *Roboto* for neutrality.
  - **Hierarchy**: Size and weight are the only tools for hierarchy.
